#Why use plain text?
- When you save something in Microsoft Word or another application like that, you are adding another layer to the file that makes it unreadable. That's not open.
- You get better as you go! You can't say that of Microsoft Word.
- Sustainability: you want to make sure that the tools you learn will still work in the future.
- Remove formatting from the writing process. Separate form and content.

#So, what should we use?
- LaTeX could work, except that it isn't very platform independent and it's hard to use.
- Markdown is a newcomer, but it's better for a lot of reasons. You can get to almost any other file format from it.

#Getting started
- Make a test directory to house all of the files for your paper.
- Make a file in that directory with a .md extension
